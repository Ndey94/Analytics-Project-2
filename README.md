This repository contains the Python Fundamentals Capstone Project, which demonstrates the core functionalities of Python in data manipulation and analysis. The project involves solving a series of tasks related to project and employee management using multiple datasets, showcasing proficiency in Python, Pandas, and NumPy.

Project Overview:
The project focuses on handling project data, including:
-Employee details
-Project costs and statuses
-Designation levels
Each task in the project requires applying Python to clean, manipulate, and analyze the datasets to extract meaningful insights.

Key Tasks:
-Dataframe Creation: Three different datasets are represented as dataframes:

-Employee Data
-Seniority Level Data

Project Data These datasets are saved into CSV files for further use in analysis.
-Handling Missing Data: Compute missing project costs using a running average with a for loop.

-Splitting Columns: Split the name column in the Employee dataframe into First Name and Last Name.

-Merging Dataframes: Join the three dataframes into a single dataframe named Final for a comprehensive view of all project details.

-Bonus Calculation: Add a new column to calculate a 5% bonus based on project cost for employees who completed their projects.

-Designation Updates: Demote employees who have failed projects and remove employees whose designation level exceeds a certain limit.

-Data Cleaning: Add titles (Mr./Mrs.) to the employee names based on gender and remove the gender column.

-Promotion Logic: Promote employees whose age is above 29 by one designation level.

-Project Cost Summary: Create a summary dataframe (TotalProjCost) that sums up the project costs per employee.

-Filtering Data: Identify and print details of employees based on specific city name criteria (cities containing the letter "o").

Tools and Libraries:
-Python: Core language used for the entire project.
-Pandas: Used for dataframe manipulation and data cleaning.
-NumPy: For numerical computations and handling missing values.
