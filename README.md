This repository contains the Python Fundamentals Capstone Project, where several coding tasks were solved using Pandas, NumPy, and other essential Python libraries. The project emphasizes data manipulation and analysis through Python programming, offering solutions to a set of real-world problems by applying these techniques.

The main objective of this project is to showcase proficiency in Python, especially in working with Pandas and NumPy for data analysis and manipulation. Throughout the project, various tasks involved creating and manipulating Pandas DataFrames to organize and analyze structured data. The project explored tasks such as filtering, grouping, merging, and aggregating data to derive useful insights. Additionally, NumPy was employed to handle efficient numerical computations, implementing mathematical and statistical operations on the datasets.

A key aspect of the project was data cleaning, where missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies were handled to prepare the dataset for analysis. Furthermore, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify trends, patterns, and outliers in the data. This included generating summary statistics and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the dataset and the relationships between variables. Custom Python functions were also written to automate repetitive tasks and simplify calculations, adding flexibility and efficiency to the workflow.

The project heavily relied on Python as the programming language and used Pandas for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical computations. The analysis and code execution were done within a Jupyter Notebook, providing an interactive environment for testing and refining the solutions.

Overall, this capstone project demonstrates a strong grasp of Python fundamentals, with a particular focus on data analysis using Pandas and NumPy. The tasks and solutions presented in this project highlight the practical applications of Python in solving complex data-related problems.
